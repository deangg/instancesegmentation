## What it does

Stage 1 segments the whole fruit. Stage 2 starts from the Stage 1 weights and segments three visible defect classes:

| Class | Visible appearance |
|---|---|
| `bruise_discoloration` | Smooth dark or discolored patch |
| `rot_mold_decay` | Soft collapsed or moldy tissue |
| `surface_damage` | Cut crack scar or dry spot |

Masks describe appearance only. They are not a disease diagnosis.

## Results

Mask metrics. Each test set was evaluated once after the model was frozen.

| Model | Runs | Val mAP50 | Test mAP50 | Test P | Test R |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Apple, two-stage YOLO26l | 21, 22 | 0.688 | 0.613 | 0.718 | 0.597 |
| Tomato, two-stage YOLO26l | 23, 24 | 0.494 | 0.393 | 0.732 | 0.375 |
| One model for both, on apple test | 25, 26 | | 0.586 | 0.769 | 0.591 |
| One model for both, on tomato test | 25, 26 | | 0.352 | 0.533 | 0.416 |

The combined model scored 0.600 validation mAP50 over both fruits. Stage 1 segments the whole fruit at 0.95 to 0.99
mask mAP50. Twenty apple test images have a near-duplicate in training. Without them apple test mAP50 is 0.504. Full
numbers are in `runs/final_metrics.json`. All 24 runs from the first pilot are in `runs/run_history.csv`.

## Run the app locally

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Put the checkpoints in `models/`:

| File | Source |
|---|---|
| `apple_stage1.pt` | `MyDrive/YOLOv26/runs/apple-stage1-whole-oct01/run21_*/weights/best.pt` |
| `apple_stage2.pt` | `MyDrive/YOLOv26/runs/apple-stage2-defects-oct01/run22_*/weights/best.pt` |
| `tomato_stage1.pt` | `MyDrive/YOLOv26/runs/tomato-stage1-whole-oct01/run23_*/weights/best.pt` |
| `tomato_stage2.pt` | `MyDrive/YOLOv26/runs/tomato-stage2-defects-oct01/run24_*/weights/best.pt` |
| `apple_tomato_stage1.pt` | `MyDrive/YOLOv26/runs/apple-tomato-stage1-whole-oct01/run25_*/weights/best.pt` |
| `apple_tomato_stage2.pt` | `MyDrive/YOLOv26/runs/apple-tomato-stage2-defects-oct01/run26_*/weights/best.pt` |

The app accepts JPG PNG WEBP and BMP uploads or built-in samples. It shows colored masks with a legend, each
defect's share of the image and of the fruit, inference time and a PNG download. A missing model or an unreadable
file gives a clear message instead of an error.

## Training

Training ran in Google Colab on one NVIDIA A100 80 GB with Ultralytics 8.4.126. See the notebook for every setting.

## AI use

Claude (Anthropic) and OpenAI Codex were used for planning, explanation, drafting and code scaffolding. The team
reviewed and tested all outputs. Full transcripts are in the submission under `ai_usage/`.
